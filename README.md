# Instagram-Auto-Liker Bot

As the name suggests, Instagram Like Bots is used to like posts on Instagram. Liking many posts, eventually leads to better reach of your own Instagram profile because as we know people get notified whenever someone likes their post. Many a times they like back and follow you too which helps grow your profile.


The project is divided into **two menu options** and asks the users to choose one of them, <br /><br />
1) The First  one **likes all the posts of the users that you follow**<br />
2) The Second one **likes all recent posts of a specific tag on Instagram.**<br /><br />

Wait and see the browser scrolling automatically and liking every picture on Instagram!
